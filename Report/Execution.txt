First execute Backend then Frontend

Execution of Backend: (Make Sure Device is Connected To Internet)

Open backend file
Open Command prompt or terminal in vscode on the file
Type: 
npm install
json-server --watch db.json -d 2000 -p 3001

Execution of Frontend: (Make Sure Device is Connected To Internet)

Open frontend file
Open Command prompt or terminal in vscode on the file
Type: 
npm install (This process takes a lot of time and depends on net speed)
npm start

While presenting to Satya make sure you remove this file and to execute frontend and backend just type npm start in terminal.
Get the backend running first then frontend

Your database is in db.json in backend
The routes of server is determined by db.json
Check The terminal
You will see this:
 Resources
  http://localhost:3001/dishes
  http://localhost:3001/comments
  http://localhost:3001/leaders
  http://localhost:3001/feedback

In db.json see lines: 2 - dishes, 284 - comments, 2059 - leaders, 2106 - feedback
These set the routes the above 4 are array of objects

Frontend uses react. The main code is in src code flows like index.html(in public file) -> index.js -> App.js -> MainComponent (In components file)
Component file consists of all the routes of the website and links all the components.

This is the best I can explain.... All the best <3
